Oh Valentine Oh Valentine, 
it is that time
where i would sit with you under a pine,
and drinking  a glass of wine.

While looking down in the city
everything covered in bokeh lights,
I just wanna say you are pretty
can we spent together the whole night ? 

I love you like the sun with her shine,
I love you like the cliffs with her coastline.
I love you like the clouds with her rain,
I love you like fire with her heat 

Love is nothing what I have 
Love is something what I am
This is you and me together 
going through every weather

No fire or coil is burning so hot,
as my love to you
and this is more than just a lot,
It is everything I got

Oh Valentine Oh Valentine, 
it is that time
where i would sit with you under a pine,
and drinking  a glass of wine.
